#### Description:
This is extension for chrome for revoking the access of social media apps.
Do you often find yourself on Facebook, Twitter, or other social media sites while youâ€™re working or studying on your PC? You can restrict your access to these distracting websites with this browser extension. Here are several files which I created.
## Files

- Content.js
    This is main file which contains our JS code which revokes the social apps.
- Manifest.json
Every extension requires a JSON-formatted file, named manifest.json, that provides important information. This file must be located in the extension's root directory.

    This file contain following things
-- manifest version
    An integer specifying the version of the manifest file format your package requires. This key is required.
-- name
 Name of extension
-- version
One to four dot-separated integers identifying the version of this extension. A couple of rules apply to the integers:
For example: 0.1.0.0 is valid version of extension.

## Installation and Usage
Installing a chrome extension locally is very easy.
Just go to extensions and turn on the Developers Mode after that click on load unpacked and then select the folder which contain our source code of extension.
Then you can see your extension in chrome extensions.
